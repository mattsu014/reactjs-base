# My React Base :)

Hi, this is my ReactJS base. Normally, I have to build this from the ground up, but it's really tiring. Repeating everything every time is not cool. So, I created this ReactJS base for myself, and I want to share it with you 🫠.

## 🚀 How to Use

First, you need to clone the React base using this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/mattsu014/reactjs-base.git
```

Next, open your project folder using this command:
```
cd reactjs-base
```

Now, you need to install the `node_modules` using this command:
```
npm install
```

And finally, install `styled-components`:
```
npm install styled-components
```

## 📂 My React Organization

### 📄 Pages
The Pages folder is self-explanatory. Here, I put all the code for each page of my website.

### 🛠️ Components
In the Components folder, I put all the "building blocks" for my code, such as Cards, Headers, and others.

Okay, that's all! This is my simple ReactJS base. You can use your creativity to create more folders and organize your code better.

Thanks for reading 🤗.
